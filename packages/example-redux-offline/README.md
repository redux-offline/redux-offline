Visualization of Redux Offline's request resolution.

## Installation

Install
```bash
yarn
```

Start the server:

```bash
yarn server
```

Then, in a new tab, start the client:

```bash
yarn start
```

This launches a Webpack dev server, which hosts the static content. Other requests are proxied to the server launched previously.
